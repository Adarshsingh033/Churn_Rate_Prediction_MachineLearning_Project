<h1>Churn Rate Prediction</h1>
<br>
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques, specifically XGBoost. By analyzing customer data, it helps businesses identify potential churners and take proactive measures for customer retention.
<br>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<br>
Problem: Customer churn negatively impacts business revenue and growth.<br>
Solution: Utilize machine learning to predict churn and implement targeted retention strategies.<br>
Approach: Train an XGBoost classifier on historical customer data to predict churn probability.<br>
Benefits: Enhance customer retention, optimize resources, and improve business profitability.<br>
<br>
<h2>Key Features</h2>
<br>
Predictive Modeling: Utilizes XGBoost algorithm for accurate churn prediction.<br>
Data Preprocessing: Handles data cleaning, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.<br>
Web Application: Includes a Flask web app for user-friendly churn predictions.<br>
Scalability: Capable of handling large datasets and scalable for real-time predictions.<br>
<br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<br>
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt<br>
Run the Flask web app: python app.py
<br>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<br>
The dataset used for training and testing is stored in data.csv.
Ensure data confidentiality and compliance with privacy regulations when handling sensitive customer information.
<br>
<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<br>
Incorporate additional machine learning algorithms for ensemble modeling.
Implement automated model retraining for improved performance over time.
Enhance the web application with interactive visualizations and analytics.<br>
