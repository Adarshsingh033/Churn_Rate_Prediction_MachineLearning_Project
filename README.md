<h1>Churn Rate Prediction</h1>
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques, specifically XGBoost. By analyzing customer data, it helps businesses identify potential churners and take proactive measures for customer retention.

###Overview
Problem: Customer churn negatively impacts business revenue and growth.
Solution: Utilize machine learning to predict churn and implement targeted retention strategies.
Approach: Train an XGBoost classifier on historical customer data to predict churn probability.
Benefits: Enhance customer retention, optimize resources, and improve business profitability.
###Key Features
Predictive Modeling: Utilizes XGBoost algorithm for accurate churn prediction.
Data Preprocessing: Handles data cleaning, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
Web Application: Includes a Flask web app for user-friendly churn predictions.
Scalability: Capable of handling large datasets and scalable for real-time predictions.
###Usage
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask web app: python app.py
Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:5000
###Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing is stored in data.csv.
Ensure data confidentiality and compliance with privacy regulations when handling sensitive customer information.
###Future Improvements
Incorporate additional machine learning algorithms for ensemble modeling.
Implement automated model retraining for improved performance over time.
Enhance the web application with interactive visualizations and analytics.
